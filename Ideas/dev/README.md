### Some resources to get you started on C# and Multithreading in .Net

 - http://www.tutorialsteacher.com/csharp/csharp-tutorials -- you don't need to memorize everything from here, read just to get an idea
 - regarding parallel tasks in .Net we have two options:
    - either we use direct OS threads as described in here: http://jonskeet.uk/csharp/threads/ --> this approach is simpler to learn in 
    the beginning, but is quite limited
    - or tasks which are like threads but with a higher level of abstraction as described in these videos: https://uptro29158-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/adrian_balanescu_student_upt_ro/Ej6haOjlamhBiDqw_7AHmcsBIExlE0SC8kAJdRjA4qMiLg
    --> task provide more functionality and are more efficient and are the default way of doing parralel programs in modern C#
    
  - for optimization of the semaphores time we will use a genetic algorithm as described in here: https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/873559/Implementing-Genetic-Algorithms-in-Csharp
  
#### we need to discuss what approach to use ASAP
